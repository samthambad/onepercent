# Hackomania 2024 Project by Peng Kiang, Samarth Thambad, Thejus, Shouhe

Challenge 1 of Hackomania 2024:
How can we develop a solution that recommends relevant Singapore Government schemes and services for businesses based on sectors?

This Web App provides a user-friendly G2B digital system that helps to guide SMEs through various stages of their business.

APIs can be easily integrated into this application to provide SMEs with convenient access to services such as
- Grants
- Loan Applications
- Permits

## Our Unique Selling Points
1. We have integrated an AI chatbot into the homepage that improves the ease of use of services for the businesses using the platform

2. We have a universal search system, that includes tags, scraping information from multiple database, helping businesses accurately find services/ network posts that they require. 

3. Our Network platform allows SMEs to advertise their services, creating a  synergistic relationship within the SME community.

### Getting Started

First, install npm packages using:
`npm i`

```bash
npm run dev 
python server.py
```
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
